     <p>
      Wow last year was crap! But it forced every one of us to reflect better on our lives.
     </p>
     <p>
      I can divide what I got from last year in two:
1. On writing ideas.
2. On a personal level.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the first part of the year I made Rocket Launcher and SecondBrainio. This is what I've learned:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       No one really cares.
      </li>
      <li>
       Failure doesn't exist outside your mind.
      </li>
      <li>
       Have fun.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      On a more personal note, from the second part of the year I got this:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       Doing nothing sometimes is the best thing to do.
      </li>
      <li>
       People have problems too.
      </li>
      <li>
       Don't be so though with yourself.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      If you're here reading this, it could look rough. But I'll clarify every point.
     </p>
     <h2>
      On Working in Projects
     </h2>
     <h3>
      No One Really Cares
     </h3>
     <p>
      I've always read that no one cares for your side projects online, in books and videos but I never understood
the extent to which people didn't care for what you do. You can see this as a barrier but in reality this is a great
potential to do things the way you want.
     </p>
     <p>
      I write it the best I can. If you're trying something new, maybe a project to which you've put a lot of dedication and heart:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        NO ONE CARES
       </strong>
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      If I could transfer my knowledge and put it in your brain I would so you wouldn't have to go through a process of doubting yourself
and fearing failure. Everyone
      <em>
       fails
      </em>
      (I'll write about this in the next section) at some point of another. Furthermore, you're going to die.
     </p>
     <p>
      So why don't just do it anyways? The best you can and how you feel should be done.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Failure doesn't exist outside your mind
     </h3>
     <p>
      As a corollary from
      <strong>
       No one really cares
      </strong>
      , nothing awful happens if you stop working on a project, unless you've already invested
a lot of money on something. 
Being a coward and doubting yourself just stops you from having fun.
     </p>
     <p>
      The fear of shame and failure is just a feeling at the end of the day. Yes, you'll feel bad. But are you going to let your feelings dictate
how you're going to live? I know I won't. Stand up and keep trying.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Have fun
     </h3>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Sit in front of the computer.
      </li>
      <li>
       Write stuff.
      </li>
      <li>
       Sip some coffee.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      This is it. Don't expect a great breakthrough.
     </p>
     <p>
      It seems like a simple thing. But I've forgotten to have fun for a long time.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you're reading this, don't forget to have fun. Your well-being matters.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Personal Side
     </h2>
     <p>
      I write this as a reminder to myself and to help others. 
Normally I wouldn't write anything personal here but these are nice 
understanding on their own and if I don't write them, it would be an incomplete review.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Doing nothing sometimes is the best thing to do
     </h3>
     <p>
      I'm serious. Taking time to reflect and being with yourself is really important.
     </p>
     <p>
      Last year I evaded many events from my life until I had a chance to face them. 
At the end this helped me have a bigger clarity and peace of mind.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the other hand when your day is not full of things to do and responsibilities you have
the chance to let your imagination act.
     </p>
     <p>
      This also applies on several things in life:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <a href="https://www.investmentnews.com/sometimes-best-strategy-is-to-do-nothing-51404">
        Sometimes the best strategy is to do nothing
       </a>
      </li>
      <li>
       <a href="http://thetaoteching.com/">
        Tao Te Ching
       </a>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      As a parenthesis, doing nothing is really hard. If you can't follow or you think this idea is stupid I can totally get you.
     </p>
     <h3>
      People have problems too
     </h3>
     <p>
      I forgot sometime that other people have problem in their lives. It's not like 
I wasn't aware of it. It was more like ignoring the fact and overlooking them.
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       <em>
        Yes, they have problems, but they're not as big as MY problems.
       </em>
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      This is crazy. But it took me a global pandemic to understand that everyone has problems, and they're important.
     </p>
     <p>
      So what's with that? I want to shift myself and my goals towards a more humane way.
     </p>
     <p>
      I'll expand on that in the future.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Don't be so thought on yourself
     </h3>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Things take time.
      </li>
      <li>
       It's fine.
      </li>
      <li>
       Rest.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      This is a reminder for me and for every lovely person who reads this.
     </p>
     <p>
      That was my 2020 in review. It might look strange but I'm pretty happy with last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      I hope you could get something from this blog post. If you want to talk, write me an email to ruben at serradas dot org.
     </p>
     <p>
      Have a great day.
