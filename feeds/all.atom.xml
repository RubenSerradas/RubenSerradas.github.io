&lt;p&gt;I can divide what I got from last year in two:
1. On writing ideas.
2. On a personal level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first part of the year I made Rocket Launcher and SecondBrainio. This is what I've learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one really cares.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure doesn't exist outside your mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more personal note, from the second part of the year I got this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing nothing sometimes is the best thing to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People have problems too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't be so though with yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're here reading this, it could look rough. But I'll clarify every point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On Working in Projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;No One Really Cares&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always read that no one cares for your side projects online, in books and videos but I never understood
the extent to which people didn't care for what you do. You can see this as a barrier but in reality this is a great
potential to do things the way you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write it the best I can. If you're trying something new, maybe a project to which you've put a lot of dedication and heart: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO ONE CARES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could transfer my knowledge and put it in your brain I would so you wouldn't have to go through a process of doubting yourself
and fearing failure. Everyone &lt;em&gt;fails&lt;/em&gt; (I'll write about this in the next section) at some point of another. Furthermore, you're going to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why don't just do it anyways? The best you can and how you feel should be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Failure doesn't exist outside your mind&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a corollary from &lt;strong&gt;No one really cares&lt;/strong&gt;, nothing awful happens if you stop working on a project, unless you've already invested
a lot of money on something. 
Being a coward and doubting yourself just stops you from having fun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fear of shame and failure is just a feeling at the end of the day. Yes, you'll feel bad. But are you going to let your feelings dictate
how you're going to live? I know I won't. Stand up and keep trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Have fun&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit in front of the computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sip some coffee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is it. Don't expect a great breakthrough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like a simple thing. But I've forgotten to have fun for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're reading this, don't forget to have fun. Your well-being matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Personal Side&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write this as a reminder to myself and to help others. 
Normally I wouldn't write anything personal here but these are nice 
understanding on their own and if I don't write them, it would be an incomplete review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Doing nothing sometimes is the best thing to do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm serious. Taking time to reflect and being with yourself is really important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I evaded many events from my life until I had a chance to face them. 
At the end this helped me have a bigger clarity and peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand when your day is not full of things to do and responsibilities you have
the chance to let your imagination act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also applies on several things in life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.investmentnews.com/sometimes-best-strategy-is-to-do-nothing-51404"&gt;Sometimes the best strategy is to do nothing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://thetaoteching.com/"&gt;Tao Te Ching&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a parenthesis, doing nothing is really hard. If you can't follow or you think this idea is stupid I can totally get you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;People have problems too&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forgot sometime that other people have problem in their lives. It's not like 
I wasn't aware of it. It was more like ignoring the fact and overlooking them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, they have problems, but they're not as big as MY problems.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is crazy. But it took me a global pandemic to understand that everyone has problems, and they're important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's with that? I want to shift myself and my goals towards a more humane way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll expand on that in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Don't be so thought on yourself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things take time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a reminder for me and for every lovely person who reads this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was my 2020 in review. It might look strange but I'm pretty happy with last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you could get something from this blog post. If you want to talk, write me an email to ruben at serradas dot org.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Things to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introducing Second Brainio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know things can become hectic sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn't it be nice if we had a second brain to save the things that we need to do later?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what we're building!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second Brainio is a personal management tool, which will help you keep things simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convention Over Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;: We'll fix the chaos. Not only provide you with solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temporary&lt;/strong&gt;:  Choose what really matters to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple&lt;/strong&gt;: We won't reinvent the wheel. We'll just help you use it properly.&lt;/li&gt;

to write and promote it I'll take a minimum viable product approach. Taking the most important features 
to solve the problem. Reduce the solution to its essence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article I'll design the &lt;a href="https://secondbrainio.com"&gt;Second Brain&lt;/a&gt; MVP and a plan to make it happen.
The first step is the analysis of the problem. 
Later I'll take the most important features for the solution to be viable.
Finally I'll describe the Playbook for this startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--
What's an MVP?
How can you do it in only one month?
Could or not?
Check the use or we and I.
--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way the Internet is structured favours consumption over production. We're overwhelmed with information
and we need to curate it and read it afterwards. Sometimes we find gold but we never read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet surfing routine can be disorganized. There are solutions out there like &lt;a href="getpocket.com"&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt;
and many others (&lt;a href="trello.com"&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="notion.so"&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="keep.google.com"&gt;Keep&lt;/a&gt;) for personal organization but nothing that unifies everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're overwhelmed with information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are many solutions out there that can help solve this issue but not in an unified manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hypotheses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the hypothesis for the solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Convention Over Configuration&lt;/em&gt;: I don't want to have tools and options to fix the chaos. I just want a solution and follow a path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Temporary&lt;/em&gt;:  Reminders tend to stay in the existing solutions for a long time. It would be nice to make it easy to delete and a time to live. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Simple List&lt;/em&gt;: There's no need to reinvent the wheel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jut by checking the different solutions:
* Trello
* Notion
* Google Keep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see that people gives a high value to order. We're supposed to be tidy and responsible in our work life
and home. Why shouldn't we be like that in our computers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solving this problem would give us a place to store our thoughts online.
Have an anchor on the Internet. Like a second brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Most Important Features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the most important features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Login and Registration - Security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Landing Page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create and Remove Links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See Links:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7 Days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pricing Infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to keep things real lean. Therefore I won't focus that much on design but instead on
shipping it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Playbook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good plan is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy DNS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create and publish the landing page to find people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact people. Start showing what I want to build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create the MVP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you go. I've taken a lean MVP approach to build &lt;a href="https://secondbrainio.com"&gt;Second Brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary:
* &lt;em&gt;Problem&lt;/em&gt;: Too Much Information. Too little time.
* &lt;em&gt;Hypothesis&lt;/em&gt;: Solve the problem with a clear solution. Avoid too many options.
* &lt;em&gt;Why?&lt;/em&gt; To have an anchor on the Internet.
* &lt;em&gt;Most Important Features&lt;/em&gt;: Security, Links, and Pricing.
* &lt;em&gt;Playbook&lt;/em&gt;: Make and promote as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why &lt;strong&gt;I want to design a system to come up …&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When you're a maker, you probably have at least one of these problems:
* You have &lt;strong&gt;no ideas&lt;/strong&gt;.
* You have &lt;strong&gt;too many ideas&lt;/strong&gt;. But not enough time to work on all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been many times in that position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why &lt;strong&gt;I want to design a system to come up and prioritise my ideas&lt;/strong&gt;.
I'm going to take Paul Graham's ideas types: organic and necessary ideas. 
From this classification, I'll list the problems I have from my daily and professional life. 
Finally, I'll explain the management matrix that I'll use to prioritise ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you come up with startup ideas?&lt;/strong&gt; From the great &lt;a href="http://paulgraham.com/organic.html"&gt;Paul Graham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to come up with startup ideas is to ask yourself the question: what do you wish someone would make for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He divides the different startups ideas in two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ones that &lt;strong&gt;grow organically from your own life&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ones that&lt;/strong&gt; you decide, from afar, that &lt;strong&gt;are going to be necessary&lt;/strong&gt; to some class of users other than you. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's make this exercise together. I'll write my ideas and categorise them following Paul's classification. 
We can prioritise them with management matrix. This way we'll check if the system
to come up and prioritise ideas is valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What's missing or broken in your daily life?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wished for someone else to build a product for you? That's the purpose of this question.
You might think that building something for only one person is silly. But here are some advantages:
* You already know there's a real problem.
* You already have a user (you!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are my real life problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passport&lt;/strong&gt;: I think this is the biggest one for me in my life currently. The Venezuelan embassy is unreliable and it's offering
only extensions to my old passport. This makes things really hard to do sometimes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visa&lt;/strong&gt;: If you're not an EU citizen, you need to ask for a visa for different countries. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money&lt;/strong&gt;: Receiving and sending money in Venezuela is really hard. Especially for people who don't have an international account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local Time Zone&lt;/strong&gt;: When you have friends scattered around the world is hard to coordinate and maintain a communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding a flat&lt;/strong&gt;: There are many loops that people need to pass in order to have a flat in Germany. Also, Immobilienscout is a joke.
  Can you change the Market Dynamics? Will the landlord always have power? Can we have a system that will allow you to have
  multiple options all the time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discover Music&lt;/strong&gt;: I don't want to be social on Spotify nor only talk about music in 4chan. It would be nice to have a HackerNews
for music. Also Streaming sucks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paleo Recipes&lt;/strong&gt;: Find new and easy to make Paleo food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pocket Clone but good&lt;/strong&gt;: Only links, be able to read from computer to phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A decent idea board&lt;/strong&gt; This is probably one of the hardest problems. I've seen people using Trello or Google Keep but I've neever
been happy with the alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A decent collaboration tool for chat&lt;/strong&gt; Microsoft Teams and Slack are still not there. There's something missing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whiteboard&lt;/strong&gt; Have you ever used a decent Whiteboard application with people? Write me if you have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tandem App&lt;/strong&gt; I'd like to help and be helped while learning a new language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write Tweets as if it were a Github project&lt;/strong&gt;.  You can think of a Twitter account as a state of tweets. If you
change a particular project then the application would change the state on a regular basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ideas that are going to be necessary.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some risks involved with working with ideas that you think are necessary. For example:
* You need to have domain knowledge from the problem.
* You need to have a group of potential customers who are interested in solving the problem.
* You need to validate if these people will pay for your product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all the things I've noticed that people miss. For Rocket Launcher
and the resource optimisation tool I've had several talks with CEOs, CTOs and System Administrators from tech companies. 
For the other ideas it's just a hunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/strong&gt;. I believe that we need a standardized CI/CD solution for small and medium companies to use. 
Think convention over configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource optimisation for Cloud&lt;/strong&gt; One of the greatest challenges of maintaining a cloud infrastructure is to have
everything in check and optimising for the price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profile-less Dating App&lt;/strong&gt; The major problem I see with traditional dating sites is the need of having a profile.
Would be nice to meet people without having a description of yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a CI/CD with a README.md file&lt;/strong&gt; READMEs are outdated constantly. If we can have a relationship between
the README and the CI/CD pipeline then we'll always have an updated documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Model to Prioritise my ideas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's organise the list of ideas we can work on.
I'm going to use the prioritisation matrix taken from my buddy Fabio Ferrari.
Finally, I'll summarise everything with a small list of projects I'll work on my &lt;a href="/12-startups-in-12-months"&gt;12 Startups in 12 Months&lt;/a&gt; idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how to prioritise my ideas?&lt;/strong&gt; I'll consider 2 variables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important is this idea for me?&lt;/strong&gt; I want to write apps that will make me proud in the future. Something I can use
in my day-to-day life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I actually pull it off?&lt;/strong&gt; Shipping and finishing a software product is a skill. Overambitious projects are great but I just
want to invest one month to: finish a minimum viable product, promote it, and get feedback. Therefore, I need to be really focused here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be expressed in a simple Excel Sheet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="prioritise-list" src="https://serradas.org/images/prioritise-list.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll take the ideas that are really important for me and I can pull it off easily. A five out of five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the finished table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="finished-list" src="https://serradas.org/images/filled-table.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I sum the scores from the headers, we get the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;7&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;6&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Money Sending&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Paleo&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Idea Board&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Flat Rental&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Whiteboard&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;CI/CD Readme&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Music Share&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Profile-less Date&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tweets&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pocket Clone&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Chat Collaboration&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tandem&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Local Time Zone&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I can choose from all the 7-score problems. I've already started with &lt;a href="https://getrocketlauncher.com"&gt;RocketLauncher&lt;/a&gt; (if you haven't
noticed). I'll go from easy to solve to hard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pocket Clone App&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music Share App&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flat Rental Problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you go! This is a simple way of organising ideas. It only considers 2 variables: importance and easiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to follow a similar approach here's a link to the template:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_IEndIJCYnPMOTkBatqaaUr2NUmxT6FBB31WvWXAxXQ/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;Priority Template&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you have and prioritise ideas? The process can be summarised in these steps:
* Ask yourself what's missing in your life?
* Ask which product is missing for a certain group of people?
* Organise these list in a management matrix with 2 variables: attainability and personal importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll be able to take the most relevant and start working on them. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

For that I'll follow a training regime for writing
SaaS web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process can be summed up like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write and finish as much software as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you go. You can stop reading now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're still here? I'll list …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I want to improve my software shipping skill. For that I'll follow a training regime for writing

&lt;p&gt;The process can be summed up like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write and finish as much software as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you go. You can stop reading now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're still here? I'll list the most common advices that
we give as software engineers. The one I got when I was starting out as a 
developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll explain why it doesn't work as many people would expect it to do. The Pots' story from the book Art &amp;amp; Fear illustrates
this point pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I'll note the number of things you need to know to do a SaaS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common advices in our industries to improve as a software engineer are passive.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read Books&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get your code reviewed by senior developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the source code of popular projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attend conferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a mentor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my career when other developer asked me for advice I'd have said something similar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed every single recommendation. My skills improved theoretically.
I'd know where to look for documentation and how to reason about problems. But that's a different 
skill set than the one we're training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The only way to improve a skill is to do it consistently.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read all the books you want about swimming but if you never get into the pool you'll never know 
if you can swim or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pots' story from Art and Fear and also &lt;a href="https://medium.com/startup-leadership/the-best-way-to-learn-something-make-a-lot-of-pots-7f4aa97e1d3a"&gt;written by Eric Scott in his blog&lt;/a&gt; illustrates well this point (just copying here):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pottery teacher split her class into two halves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the first half she said, “You will spend the semester studying pottery, planning, designing, and creating your perfect pot. At the end of the semester, there will be a competition to see whose pot is the best”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the other half she said, “You will spend your semester making lots of pots. Your grade will be based on the number of completed pots you finish. At the end of the semester, you’ll also have the opportunity to enter your best pot into a competition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first half of the class threw themselves into their research, planning, and design. Then they set about creating their one, perfect pot for the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second half of the class immediately grabbed fistfulls of clay and started churning out pots. They made big ones, small ones, simple ones, and intricate ones. Their muscles ached for weeks as they gained the strength needed to throw so many pots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of class, both halves were invited to enter their most perfect pot into the competition. Once the votes were counted, all the best pots came from the students that were tasked with quantity. The practice they gained made them significantly better potters than the planners on a quest for a single, perfect pot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers tend to get stuck in the researching, planning and designing loop. Trying to make everything perfect.
Finding the best practices and the best frameworks. This is useless for reaching the end goal: writing something useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having said that we still need to have a small plan to improve certain skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to build Software as a Service applications. You'll need to focus on the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basics of a web application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pricing Page and Subscription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User Management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's go through each of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basic of a Web Application&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a never-ending way of building web applications. I choose Ruby and Rails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Elegant Weapon for a more civilized age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned Ruby + JavaScript a long time ago. Basically by reading all the books I could find. 
Here are some old and new articles for learning it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/"&gt;Learning Ruby in 20 Minutes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-ruby-from-zero-to-hero-90ad4eecc82d/"&gt;Learning Ruby from Zero to Hero&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/"&gt;Eloquent JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html"&gt;Getting Started with Rails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/"&gt;Rails Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html"&gt;Working with JavaScript in Rails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CSS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSS is my weakness. I'll write another article about this. But for now I'll use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/"&gt;tailwindcss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://getbootstrap.com/"&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pricing and Subscription&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://stripe.com/"&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://paddle.com/"&gt;Paddle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jasminek.net/blog/post/payment-solutions/"&gt;Which Subscription Payment Service Should A Bootstrapping SaaS Choose?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;User Management&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/heartcombo/devise"&gt;devise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan"&gt;CanCanCan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deployment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/es/elasticbeanstalk/"&gt;Elastic Beanstalk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.docker.com/"&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you go. I believe that the only way of improving a skill is to consistently do it.
Common practices to improve are normally passive and they don't work as expected.
My plan is to go through the basics of a web application, CSS, pricing, user management and finally
deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12 Startups in 12 Months. This my new foolproof master plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to give you some context for this decision: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's my current startup journey so far? Not the best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do projects take so long to ship? Fear, lack of experience and a clear timeline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who are my influences? Scott Adams, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why does this plan make sense?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who's done this so far?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll start on August 1st of 2020 and I'll update this article every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I were to describe my whole entrepreneurship story as of now I'd say it could be better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
My focus until I turned up 25 was to leave my country and when I came to Germany I realised
that I wanted to start my own company. Now, when you don't master the language from the country you're
in and you're new it's harder, or at least that is what I thought about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I think that if you want to do something you should do it. Especially if it's something where you don't need any
permissions to do it like in the software industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a series of failed attempts up my sleeves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Bitcoin Wallet, which I never finished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HelloPaket a project that tried to solve the problems of missed deliveries in Germany.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My participation on the Founder Institute with my idea Rocket Launcher, a platform for Software as a Service web applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short they never came to be. At least not for me. What these projects have in common is
that I took too long to ship them. Even with &lt;a href="https://getrocketlauncher.com"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; I feel like I've taken too long to release
the project and have traction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do projects take so long to ship?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear:&lt;/strong&gt; Simple as that. If you take months to come up with an idea and you realise 
that people don't care about your ambitions and dreams is painful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of Experience:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm starting to believe that shipping successfully a software product is a skill that
can be learned and needs to be practiced. Like going to the gym.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of a clear timeline:&lt;/strong&gt; When you don't have a time goal in mind, you can extend the development of a useless
 product for a long time. This takes a lot of time and money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what am I going to do about it?&lt;/strong&gt; My patience and time is finite and I can't wait forever creating the perfect product.
I want to build a SaaS application and offer it online. Even if the application is not perfect, it'll will help me to
get closer to success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the following influences right now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scott Adams &lt;a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/2013/11/18/goals-vs-systems/"&gt;Systems vs Goals&lt;/a&gt; idea: To summarize it, winners think in systems and losers in goals. Systems 
have the advantage of always working even if the goal has not been reached.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amy Hoy's &lt;a href="https://stackingthebricks.com/year-of-hustle/"&gt;Year of Hustle&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href="https://stackingthebricks.com/just-fucking-ship/"&gt;Just Fucking Ship&lt;/a&gt;:
I need to finish the stuff that I start and finally putting a price on it to sell it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul Graham's &lt;a href="http://paulgraham.com/startuplessons.html?viewfullsite=1"&gt;Startup Lessons&lt;/a&gt;: 
The purpose of a startup is to learn and growth as fast as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pieter Levels' &lt;a href="https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/"&gt;12 Startups in 12 Months&lt;/a&gt;: This idea was the one who made everything come together. 
It creates a system that will allow me to get used to come up with ideas and ship them fast to see if 
the market likes it or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does this make sense?&lt;/strong&gt; I believe this strategy make sense from three different perspectives:
* &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychological&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Instead of waiting around to die, I finish something quickly that I can sell. Finishing stuff
gives you a momentum that you want to keep. Larger projects are hard to finish because they're too ambitious.
For someone who has no experience in managing companies, it's harder.
* &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unfair Advantage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: An unfair advantage is something that you have as a founder that makes you the ideal guy
to build a company or product.
I recently moved to Berlin, almost no one knows me here and I just passed through a family crisis. 
In terms of unfair advantage I have not much. My technical knowledge, my focus and being crazy.
* &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: My war fund are being depleted and I need to be quicker than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who else has done this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pieter Levels &lt;a href="https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/"&gt;Original: I'm launching 12 Startups in 12 Months&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yong Fook &lt;a href="https://blog.yongfook.com/12-startups-in-12-months.html"&gt;12 Startups in 12 Months&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mwadah Osman &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@mwadah.osman/12-startups-in-12-months-challenge-98052a30fad3"&gt;12 Startups in 12 months challenge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's see how this goes. I'll be listing all of my startups the following months. I'll start the countdown 1st of August
2020. For now, I'll be doing clones of other websites with Ruby on Rails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List of Startups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work In Progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I hope that with this I'll change my way of describing my startups journey. I've had many failures in 
the past and I think it has to do mostly with fear, lack of experience and a clear timeline.
With the ideas from Scott Adams, Amy Ahoy and Pieter Levels I expect to create a system that will allow me
to create a system to test ideas and ship them fast. There are some people already online who has tried
this with good results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#why-not"&gt;Why don't we build a cloud?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's get down to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="current"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The State of Affairs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does this question even matter?&lt;/strong&gt; The Cloud Computing ecosystem changes constantly, and we want to be informed to make decisions.
There are 3 trends happening right now in the cloud world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Companies are increasingly migrating their workloads to the public clouds&lt;/strong&gt;. 
2020 is the year when workloads are higher on the public clouds than on private solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The market is being dominated by big players&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The cloud compute is hybrid.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Majority of workloads will go to the cloud in 2020.&lt;/strong&gt; From &lt;a href="https://allcloud.io/go/2020-cloud-infrastructure-report/"&gt;AllCloud's Cloud Infrastructure Report&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="https://info.flexera.com/SLO-CM-REPORT-State-of-the-Cloud-2020"&gt;Flexera's 2020 State of the Cloud Report&lt;/a&gt;
more than 50 percent of enterprise workloads and data are expected to be in a public cloud within 12 months. This event
didn't take the industry by surprise: there are reports that projected the change to happen this year. It was accelerated due 
to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt text" src="https://serradas.org/images/cloud-usage.png" title="Cloud vs on premise usage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon is leading the Cloud Market.&lt;/strong&gt; AWS has one third of the cloud market share followed by Microsoft's Azure. 
The cloud business is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect"&gt;network effect&lt;/a&gt; business. 
Its value increases according to the number of other clients using it. AWS counts with the biggest educational network,
consulting companies, blog spots, documentation from third party providers, and the AWS Marketplace.
Amazon will continue to dominate the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The cloud computing future is hybrid.&lt;/strong&gt; The industry is adopting a hybrid approach for its infrastructure needs.
Companies are using multiple public and private clouds at the same time.
Teams are taking advantage from different cloud provider's services. 
Only one cloud provider is not enough to meet most of the companies requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt text" src="https://serradas.org/images/types-of-cloud.png" title="Hybrid Cloud Usage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We're living exciting years for the cloud.&lt;/strong&gt; The old ways of managing our computing workloads are giving way to 
more flexible solutions provided by private and public cloud providers. Amazon has most of the cloud market share, thanks to its network
effect. But even if Amazon dominates the market, companies are using more than one cloud provider for their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="cloud"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What's the cloud anyways?&lt;/h3&gt;

--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand what the cloud is. We need to see what cloud computing is.
Later, we'll define the different functionalities we need in order to have a minimum viable cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud Definition.&lt;/strong&gt; From Wikipedia we have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, 
especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Service Models&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Our definition is broad, therefore we have multiple service models to enumerate:
* &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infrastructure as A Service:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We don't have control over the underlying
cloud infrastructure but has control over the operating system, storage and applications. Popularized by AWS, Azure and GCP.
* &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platform as a Service:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; With this service model we have control only over the deployed application. Examples are Google App Engine and
Amazon Fargate.
* &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Software as a Service:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We have the capability of using an application through diverse clients. The greatest example is Salesforce. 
* &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Backend as a Service:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Web app and mobile app developers are provided with a way to link their applications to cloud storage and cloud computing services with application programming interfaces (APIs) exposed to their applications and custom software development kits (SDKs). Firebase is a good example
of backend as a service for mobile applications.
* &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Serverless Computing:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Fully managed code by the cloud provider. Popularized by AWS Lambda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://www.fugue.co/blog/2014-08-11-minimum_viable_cloud.html"&gt;Josh Stella's Minimum Viable Cloud article&lt;/a&gt; there are 
other characteristics that are important for a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minimum Viable Cloud&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: 
* &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elasticity:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A cloud should be able to serve quickly its customers demands.
* &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fault Tolerance:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Or having resources in multiple geographical locations so even if a catastrophe happens
applications would run.
* &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Operational Expenditure instead of Capital Expenditure:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Pay as you go approach and not in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of now it seems that only the companies that we've seen before are the ones who satisfy all the marks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fundamental characteristics of the cloud model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are:
* An API for requesting computing and data resources.
* Lack of active user management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why there are so many service models for cloud computing. But we want to build a Cloud.
There are other conditions we need to follow:
* Elasticity.
* Fault Tolerance.
* OpEx instead of CapEx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="why-not"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why don't we build a Cloud?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we're ready to answer the question &lt;em&gt;can we even build our own cloud?&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, there's a path we can follow in order to build our own Cloud.
I'll write about OpenStack, a popular Cloud operating system.
Next, I'll list companies that are doing their own cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Existing solutions.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.openstack.org/"&gt;OpenStack&lt;/a&gt; is the most popular solution for the creation of public
and private cloud providers. Why don't we have public clouds everywhere? There are many &lt;a href="https://www.openstack.org/foundation/companies/"&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt;
using OpenStack but most of it &lt;a href="https://www.openstack.org/analytics"&gt;usage&lt;/a&gt; comes from Private Clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt text" src="https://serradas.org/images/openstack.png" title="OpenStack"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we were to use OpenStack we would need to have Fault Tolerance for our use case, which is something hard to satisfy
without having multiple data centers in different geographical regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are companies trying to make a cloud by themselves or which have done it in the past&lt;/strong&gt;:
* &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/"&gt;DigitalOcean&lt;/a&gt;: From the founders of a managed hosting business, ServerStack. DigitalOcean
targets developers and startups instead of enterprise clients. They raised a Seed Funding of US$3.2 million. 
* &lt;a href="https://render.com/"&gt;Render&lt;/a&gt;: "The Easiest Cloud for all your Apps and Websites" from their website. They take advantage
of Kubernetes plus AWS in order to provide a platform for applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It introduces 2 different paths. Either getting a lot of funding at the beginning 
or using a public cloud to bootstrap your business. Reinventing the wheel tempt can tempt us.
But there is a lack of innovation and a clear business case for innovating in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a public cloud is not an easy feat. There are many aspects that we need to accomplish in order to make the customer
happy. Nevertheless, there are companies who've already done it from scratch. For this we have 2 paths:
* Funding
* Bootstrap it using another public cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation will be one of the most important things in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you go! The answer of this question is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;perhaps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many trends in the cloud market at this moment. Companies have a hybrid infrastructure, one
that depends on multiple clouds providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've understood that apart from an API and lack of active user management from resources we also need
to have elasticity, fault tolerance, and OpEx instead of CapEx in order to have a Minimum Viable Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we were able to check the different paths we could to take in order to make a cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

towards to different cloud providers. 
Moreover 2020 is the year where companies are choosing to use the cloud over their own servers. 
But why? Because managing your own physical infrastructure is painful and costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this environment it’s only logical that companies are taking the steps needed to remove any maintenance cost.
 This way technologists are focused 100% in the business and the money is invested more efficiently. Sounds good right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess what? You’ll still need to maintain your cloud infrastructure and it’s easy to make mistakes. Were you using a database for testing and forgot
 to delete it? Yeah that’s going to be 800$ extra this month. You didn’t consider these expenses and 
we didn’t tell you about it? Well since we follow the shared responsibility principle, this is 100% your fault. 
The main advantage of the cloud is that it’s &lt;em&gt;E L A S T I C&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One cool thing about many cloud providers like AWS is that they offer services for your own infrastructure that you can use easily with their libraries. But now let’s say you have a team of engineers that know what they’re doing and you’re happy with the current setup. Everything is automated and they’re following all the best practices. They’re even taking advantage of all the options provided by your cloud provider! What happens if the cloud provider decides to change the pricing for a particular service and you depend on it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally you’ll have to:
 * Evaluate a new solution.
 * Decide from the douzens of open source solutions that are out there: This is easier said than done. Nerds tend to argue a lot.
 *  Make a migration plan.
 * Migrate: This is a never ending task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yeah this is just fear mongering. Your team can just simply go for those sweet open source solutions out there. 
Besides, your cloud provider probably it’s offering multiple managed open source solutions! 
So generous of them! They’re doing so much for the FOSS community. Nice, I just see 2 problems with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens if they don’t provide the open source solution and it’s an integral part of your architecture? 
Then you maintain it baby. Have fun hiring that guy who’s an expert on that technology and he’s expecting a big fat salary for that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The managed solution is kinda open source. So basically your team won’t have full control over it and you won’t have the latest features. 
What? Am I being too naggy? Well maybe but it’s still true. Normally these services are updated slower than the rate their FOSS brothers are being released. There’s a bug that was fixed in a newer version? Well you’ll have to wait, along with hundreds of others companies that are in line. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, the overall pricing for the cloud is just insane. Most of the big cloud providers give you a calculator so you can predict 
your infrastructure prices. But basically you don’t know how the business is going to look like in the future. 
You also don’t know how the prices of their services is going to change so it’s a futile exercise. 
Once you’re there using their services it’s also really hard to know what’s happening, since they charge for things you cannot predict like network usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s the deal how can we fix this? I don’t know to be honest. 
I’m still thinking about it. Do you want to see something cool? Go to &lt;a href="https://getrocketlauncher.com"&gt;getrocketlauncher.com&lt;/a&gt;. 
We’re trying to remove a little bit of bullshit day by day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I researched for …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've launched several personal projects websites since I started to code professionally in Europe. They had to do with different topics that ranged from startups to potential open source solutions. I wrote the websites in different moments of my life, but I noticed a similar experience every-time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I researched for a website building framework or a content management system: that's pretty straightforward ✅.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote the content for the website: not easy but for a first "good enough" version is not so bad ☑️.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I looked online for some nice illustrations and logos for the website: this was the hardest step for me ⛔️.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did I do to fix this problem at those moments? Well I used the method that solves everything: I threw some money at the problem. The outcome at the end? At the beginning it worked fine but when the project failed I always got a bittersweet aftertaste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled randomly recently with a hackernews article which provided free illustrations and resources for creating websites that really excited me. Unfortunately I didn't save the article, just the project. To avoid that in the future I'm writing a list of resources for my future self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to organise the list in resources that I've used in real life and another for things that I need to consider later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Real Life Ruben Usage:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://undraw.co/"&gt;undraw&lt;/a&gt;: open source illustrations for any project. This is the project that inspired me to write this article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drawkit.io/"&gt;DrawKit&lt;/a&gt;: Not open source but it has some free illustration. There's also some paid content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura"&gt;sakura&lt;/a&gt;: Classless css framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To Consider:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/neutraltone/Awesome-Stock-Resources#public-domain"&gt;Awesome Stock Resources List&lt;/a&gt;: Awesome Github list of stock resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/heyalexej/awesome-images"&gt;Awesome Images&lt;/a&gt;: Awesome Github list of images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to be updating this from time to time. Do you know any other resource that I can include? Let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this can be helpful to you too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="website-resources"></category><category term="lists"></category><category term="recommendations"></category></entry></feed>
